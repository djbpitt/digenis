      <span class="page">[16r] </span>And so he equipped his envoys and sent off an epistle to Devgenij and with

         Famed Devgenij! I very much want to see you. Do not hesitate now to visit my tsardom;
            your daring and courage have resounded over all the earth.

<div id="e9">
   <p>

      <span class="page">[16v] </span>And then he ordered the envoys to say to their tsar: If you wish to see
            me, an unworthy one, then take a few warriors with you, so as not to anger me, for youth
            brings many irrational acts with it.

         and having gathered them together, he moved off with that force to the place indicated by
         Devgenij. And having come to the River Euphrates, he set up his tents at some distance from
         the river.

            with your innumerable force and you will see the courage of an insignificant man who
