(Tit 183v) Of the Marriage of Devgenij and the Abduction of Stratigovna 

1. Glorious Devgenij began (184) ever to think about Stratigovna, how he might see Stratig and his children and all his soldiers and the fair Stratigovna. 

2. His father and mother began to restrain him: "Child, give up this thought. 

3. Many have thought about Stratig himself and about Stratigovna, how they might see her, but it has availed them not."

4. Glorious Devgenij took a prayer from his father and from his mother and assembled a few soldiers 

5. and took (with) him costly vestments and a musical zither 

6. and mounted a horse, his swift Far', and went to Stratig.

7. And he reached the border of Stratig's land and went within five leagues of the city 

8. and disposed his army and ordered them to mount guard among themselves and to be strong, while he himself went to Stratig's city. 

9. And he entered the city through the gates of the city of Stratig 

10. and met a youth of Stratig's court and questioned him about Stratig and about his sons and about Stratigovna herself.

11. The youth replied to him: "Our lord Stratig is not at home, but hunting in another country with his four sons. 

12. And you ask about Stratigovna: to our lord there is not another so fair in the world. Many have (184v) come, but no one has looked in her eyes, 

13. since Stratig is brave and strong, and his sons, and the rest of his army; one will attack a hundred. 

14. Stratigovna herself has manly boldness; 

15. to no one else is she like save to you."

16. When Devgenij heard, he was joyful, since it had been shown to him and written: "He who joins with Stratigovna will live for thirty-six years." 

21. (Pog 10) When she heard this, the maiden Stratigovna peered out the window and spoke to Devgenij: "My bright light and beautiful sun! I pity you, my lord, that you wish to perish on account of your love for me, 

22. for many have laid down their heads on my account, even without seeing me and never having spoken a word with me. And who are you who has determined on such a brazen deed? 

23. My father is, you know, exceptionally brave and my brothers are powerful, and my father has many warriors, each of whom can taken on a hundred. And you have so few men with you." 

24. Devgenij answered the maiden: "If I did not fear God, then I would commit you to death. But answer me quickly what is in your thoughts: do you wish to become the wife of Devgenij Akrit or do you wish to be a captive ï¿½ a servant?"

25. When she heard this, the girl answered him tearfully: "If you love me so strongly, then quickly abduct me while neither my father (10v) and nor my mighty brothers are at home. 

26. But why must you abduct me? I wish go off with you myself, only dress me in men's clothing. 

27. For I have the daring of a man! 

28. If they catch up to me along the way, I will not disgrace myself. Many have been unable to overcome me."

31. (13) When he had heard this, Devgenij kissed her and rode out against them, and he met them far out in the field. 

32. He struck like a strong falcon at the center of the army, like a good mower he cut them down like grass: he galloped through them once and killed seven thousand; he returned and killed twenty thousand. 

33. A third time he galloped and he caught up to Stratig. He hit him lightly with his club (13v) on the top of his helmet and knocked him from his horse. 

34. And Stratig began imploring Devgenij: 

35. "Be content with the abducted maiden, my beautiful daughter. Let me live!" 

36. And Devgenij let him go but he caught up to his sons, bound them, and led them off with him. 

37. He did not tie up Stratig. 

38. And binding the army, he drove them before him like a shepherd a flock of sheep to where the maiden was standing. 

39. And she saw her father and said: "That is what I told you, father, but you would not believe me." 

40. And Devgenij ordered his servants to drive the bound warriors of Stratig and he led Stratig himself and his sons along with him.

41. And so then Stratig grew sad and together with his sons began to plead with Devgenij, saying to him: 

42. "You did not condemn us to death but granted us life, so do not cart us off with you but return us our liberty." 

43. And the maiden heard the pleading of her father and brothers and she began asking Devgenij: 

44. (14) "I was given into your hands by God. 

45. You are the ruler not only of me but also of my family. You have defeated many warriors already but give my father and brothers back their liberty, do not grieve my mother who nursed your wife." And as the maiden spoke this way, 

46. Devgenij heeded her and said to Stratig: "I shall have mercy on your age and grant you and your sons freedom, but I shall place my brand upon you."

51. (14v) When he had returned to his own country, he sent his trusted servants with great ceremony to his father and mother with the news and requested of them that they prepare a glorious wedding. And he said to his father: 

52. "You, father, were formerly famed for your strength and glory, and now I, with the help of God and your blessing and the prayers of my mother, what I conceived of has all come true. 

53. I have no opponent. Stratig alone was stronger than all knights, but with God's help he could not stand against me, for I abducted his daughter. 

54. And now, father, with great honors come out to greet me and Stratigovna." 

55. And his runners came to him and told the father all that Devgenij had told them to say.

56. And upon hearing this, his father and mother rejoiced (15) and began preparing for the wedding, and they summoned the entire city and they went out to meet Devgenij and Stratigovna, and they met them eight versts from the city with great honors. 

57. And all knelt down before Devgenij, exclaiming: "O great is the miracle accomplished by you, a young lad, o noble is your daring! You have defeated Stratig and abducted his daughter!" 

58. And Devgenij replied: "It was not I who defeated the force of Stratig; he was defeated by the force of God!" 

61. (16) So Devgenij returned home, having seen Stratig off, and he freed all the captives. 

62. And he branded his uncle Filipap on the face and then sent him off to where he had come from, 

63. and Maksimiana's liberation he announced through his servants. 

64. And then he began living and prospering and going hunting, for he loved these bogatyr's pursuits.

Dox. Oh, what a great miracle, brothers! Who would not be astonished at it? He was an unusual man and he became such not from Amir but he was sent down by God. All brave Christians learned of his glory, and he was made famous throughout all the world with the aid of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom glory with the Father and the Holy Spirit now and forevermore and in eternity, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
