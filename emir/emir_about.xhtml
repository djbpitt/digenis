        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>This edition represents a part of the efforts of one of the authors (Robert Romanchuk) to
            produce a critical edition of the Slavic version of the 12th-c. Byzantine <q>romantic
                epic</q>
            <cite>Digenis Akritis</cite>, reliable enough for Slavists interested in the work’s life
            and reception from the 14th c. to the 18th, but also of use to Byzantinists. If in 1978
            Michael Jeffreys, <q>in despair about the difficulty of progress</q> on questions around
            the Slavic text, proposed that it be treated with the same caution as <q>Akritic</q>
            folksongs collected in the 19th c., and if twenty years later its continued
                <q>problematic</q> status allowed it to be <q>left out of account</q> in Elizabeth
            Jeffreys’s magisterial edition of the two oldest Greek versions—the failed romance in MS
            Grottaferrata (or <b>G</b>) and the approximated epic in Escorial (or <b>E</b>)—then
            today these questions are well on their way to being resolved.</p>
        <p><img id="stemma_img" src="images/stemma-transparent.png" style="float:right;" />We have
            known for some time that Henri Grégoire was in error by aligning the Slavic
                <cite>Digenis</cite> (in its earliest form, Erich Trapp’s version <b>ρ</b>) with the
            prototype of the work. Yet neither is the Slavic version <b>ρ</b> the transcription of
            an oral epic, as some Byzantinists still imagine, nor is it a reflex of the 16th-c.
            omnibus version <b>Z</b>, as John Mavrogordato supposed. Rather, it is a distant cousin
            of <b>G</b>, as Trapp showed in his synoptic edition of the Greek versions. Moreover,
            and against the majority opinion in the Slavic field, <b>ρ</b> is almost certainly not
            Rusian (East Slavic), but was most probably produced in bilingual and bicultural 14th-c.
            Macedonia—as André Vaillant proposed—in the era of Stefan Dušan. In places <b>ρ</b>
            shadows <b>G</b> line for line and word for word, reflecting Trapp’s hyparchetype
                <b>ξ</b>, shared ancestor of <b>G</b> and <b>ρ</b>, better than does <b>G</b>: e.g.,
                <b>ρ</b> lacks the gnomic interpolations of <b>G</b>, as does <b>Z</b>; <b>ρ</b>
            also preserves certain oral-traditional formulas of the prototype in their original
            form, as Trapp demonstrated. But in many places <b>ρ</b> has been reworked from <b>ξ</b>
            in an oral-formulaic mode, far more radically than <b>E</b> has been.</p>
        <p>What is more, half of <b>ρ</b>—including the opening <q>Lay of the Emir</q>, the episode
            treated by this site—is extant only in the 17th-c. Muscovite (Russian) abridgment
                <b>ψ</b> (Kuz′mina’s <q>second redaction</q>) that reorders entire sections of plot,
            deletes descriptive passages, and further <q>folklorizes</q> the text. The Slavic
                <q>Lay</q> is something of a narrative chaos in the abridgment, at least from the
            point of view of the Greek versions that preserve the original ordering. When an episode
            is extant in both the 14th-c. <b>ρ</b> (in the form of MS <b>Тх</b>) and the 17th-c.
            abridgment <b>ψ</b>, plot material from the former may be freely reordered in the
            latter: thus, in the education and hunt scenes that open the <q>Romance of Digenis</q>
            episode, the Muscovite editor moves the dove-white horse that the hero gains at the end
            of his investiture to the very beginning; inverts the order of killing the bears and the
            deer (in Slav, a moose), forgetting about the he-bear in the meantime; and eliminates a
            great deal of description and dialogue besides.</p>
        <p>In 2015, making use of Roderick Beaton’s 1993 reconstruction of the <q>common core</q> of
            the <q>Lay of the Emir</q> (which he based on his close comparison of MSS <b>E</b> and
                <b>G</b>), Robert Romanchuk and his FSU Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program
            assistant Thuy-Linh Pham recovered the probable original (Greek) ordering of the Slavic
            material of the <q>Lay</q> preserved in the abridgment <b>ψ</b>. The present site shows
            the ordering of Beaton's <q>core</q>; Romanchuk and Pham’s reconstructed (hypothesized)
            ordering of the <q>Lay</q> in <b>ρ</b>, which follows the <q>core</q>; and the Muscovite
            editor’s <q>shuffling</q> of narrative passages in <b>ψ</b>, in a holistic visualization
            of their interrelationships known as a plectogram (the invention of Hugh Olmsted).</p>
        <!--<p>[More technical material can go here.]</p>-->
        <p>Large parts of the <b>ρ</b> narrative have been reordered in the Muscovite abridgment
                <b>ψ</b>. First, most of passages <i>ibis</i> to <i>9bis</i> (the youngest brother’s
            combat with the Emir, his defeat and his lies to the brothers, which motivate the scenes
            that follow) have been swapped with passages <i>10</i> to <i>21</i> (the brothers’
            interrogation of the Saracen at the tents of the Emir’s army, their discovery of the
            slaughtered Christian maidens and angry return to the Emir). Thus in the abridgment, the
            brothers meet their informant at the tents even before encountering the Emir himself.
            Characteristically for Slav, this Saracen is hypertrophied into an army of 3000, quickly
            cut down to three, who, in the abridgment, lead them to the Emir instead of the girls.
            At passage <i>8</i> in <b>ψ</b>, a bout of folkloric boasting (Stith Thompson's motif
            W117) is interpolated: <q>Tell us, Emir, have you no guards posted on the way? We
                reached the tent without any resistance</q> (MS <b>Тт</b>, f. 173v). The duplicated
                <q>but now tell us</q> bears witness to the motif papering over the seam.</p>
        <p>At a finer level of detail, passages <i>23</i> (the brothers’ final threat) and
                <i>25–26</i> (the Emir’s offer to convert and marry the girl) have inexplicably been
            inverted from the ordering of the Greek <q>core</q>. To help the Muscovite reordering
            cohere, the motif of association of equals and unequals (J410) enters passage <i>23</i>:
                <q>How can we give our sister to a slave?</q> (f. 175v). This passage is generally
            supposed to belong to the Muscovite editor, as it makes use of the East Slavic
            vernacular form <i>kholop</i>.</p>
        <p>The second large-scale reordering of the narrative is an exchange of passages <i>63</i>
            to <i>70</i>, the Emir’s intent to visit Syria (in <b>ρ</b>, his trip to <q>Arabia</q>),
            with most of passages <i>35</i> to <i>52</i>, his mother’s threatening letter, which
            motivates the Emir’s journey in the first place! And the birth of Digenis
                (<i>33bis–34</i>), which in the original ordering follows the Emir’s conversion and
            wedding to the girl, has been postponed to the end of the abridgment’s <q>Lay</q>. In
            these cases too, folkloric material (motifs P678; M301.4, M311[.0.2.1]) are employed to
            stitch the narrative back together.</p>
        <p>The Muscovite reworking of the plot of the <q>Lay of the Emir</q> has a marvelous basis.
            Its logic appears to be that of Vladimir Propp’s <cite>Morphology of the folk
                wondertale</cite>: all tests of the heroes (e.g., finding the dead girls) are now
            grouped before the struggle with the villain (single combat with the Emir)—in Propp’s
                <q>algebra</q>, sequences <i>DEF</i> precede sequence <i>HI</i>; while the mother’s
            letter, rather than motivating the Emir’s visit, is here treated as a villainous pursuit
            of the hero in response to his completing the difficult task of his journey—that is,
            Propp’s sequence <i>PrRs</i> follows sequence <i>MN</i>. And the hero’s reward <i>W</i>,
            the birth of his son, is at the end of the tale, where the wondertale demands it.</p>
