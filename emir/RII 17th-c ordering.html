                <i>A Tale of Bygone Times and Brave Men, about the Boldness and about the Bravery

            <span>There was a widow of royal family, and she devoted herself to salvation; she was
                never away from church. And she had three sons, splendid and handsome; with their
                mother's prayer they were brave in all that they did. The widow also had a daughter,
                splendid and beautiful in the beauty of her face.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And Amir the tsar of the Arab land heard of the maiden's beauty and assembled his
                force, full large, and went to attack the Greek land for the sake of this maiden's
                beauty. And Amir the tsar came to the house of the widow and carried off the fair
                    <span style="color:blue">(343)</span> maiden by his cunning; he was invisible to
                everyone in the Greek land, save that one old woman of the house saw him. At the
                time her mother was in God's church; the sons were hunting in another
                country.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And the widow came from God's church and did not find her fair daughter and began
                to question her slaves in her house about her fair daughter. And all the slaves of
                her house said to her: "We do not know, Lady, about your fair daughter." Save that
                one old woman of the house had seen and told her mistress, the widow: "Lady, Amir
                the tsar of the Arab land came and stole away your daughter, our mistress, by his
                cunning, and he was invisible in our land."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And on hearing this from her slave the widow began to tear the hair from her head
                and [to tear] her face, and she began to weep over her fair <span style="color:blue"
                    >(343v)</span> daughter and said: "Woe is me, wretched widow. If my children had
                been at home, they would have gone and pursued Amir the tsar and taken away their
                sister."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>After a little while her children came home, and seeing their mother weeping they
                began to question their mother: "Tell us, our mother, who has insulted you, whether
                a tsar or a prince of this city? If you have been insulted, we shall not live."<span
                    style="color:red"> /_</span></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>a.</span>
            <span>Their mother said to them: "My dear children, I have not been insulted by anyone
                of this city, rather you have had at home one sister, and she has now been stolen
                away by the hands of Amir the tsar of the Arabian land. And he has torn out my heart
                by the roots and pierced me like a lifeless reed. And now I adjure you, my beloved
                children, that <span style="font-style:italic;">you<i> </i></span>fail not to
                hearken to my command. Go and pursue Amir the tsar and take away your fair little
                sister; <span style="color:red">/a</span>

            <span>if your sister <span style="color:blue">(Tit 172)</span> you do not recover, do
                you thus lay down your heads for your little sister, and I (shall lament) all of you
                since I shall have no children."<span style="color:red"> /b</span></span>
        </p>
        <p>

            <span>Her sons said: "Our mother, do not be distressed and do not worry about this;
                quickly give us your prayer and we shall cover our way." They girt themselves with
                their weapons and mounted their horses and went like gold-winged hawks; their horses
                seemed to fly beneath them. They reached the borders of the Saracen land; <span
                    style="color:red">/c </span></span>
        </p>
        <p>

            </span>
            <span style="color:red">=11ter. </span>
            <span>they came upon a Saracen standing guard. And the brothers began to question him:
                "Tell us, Saracen, how far to the abode of your Amir the tsar?" But the Saracen drew
                his sword; he ran upon them boldly, thinking them deserters, not knowing their
                    boldness.<span style="color:red"></span></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And the youngest brother sprang, grasped the Saracen by the throat and dragged him
                to his brothers and wished to slay him. The eldest brother said to them: "My dear
                brothers! Why should we defile our swords upon a Saracen? Let us defile them upon
                Amir the tsar himself, – he is guilty!" This Saracen they tied <span
                    style="color:blue">(172v)</span> to a tree on a mountain. <span
                    style="color:red">/<span>dbis</span>=11ter</span></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>11.</span>
            <span>And they themselves went their way and came upon many guards of Amir the tsar
                    <span style="color:red">/11 </span></span>
        </p>
        <p>

            <span>beyond a great river called <span>Bagrjanica</span>; <span style="color:red">/d

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>11bis.</span>
            <span>they were three thousand in number. The brothers saw the great guard of Amir the
                tsar and the eldest brother said: "My brothers, it <span>were</span> well to ride
                together against the guards of Amir the tsar." But the middle brother said: "My dear
                brothers, the guard of Amir the tsar is large; let us divide in three."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>The eldest brother (went) on the right hand, the middle in the center, the
                youngest on the left hand; they sprang upon the men of Amir the tsar and began to
                strike them as good mowers mow grass: some they bound, some they slaughtered, and
                they drove them among them like good <span>shepherds</span> sheep. They chased them
                and killed them; only three men did they spare to lead them to Amir the tsar.<span
                    style="color:red"> /11bis</span>

        <p>
            <span>e=37bis+45-48bis.</span>
            <span>And they began to question them: "Tell us, Saracens, does Amir the tsar dwell in
                your city or not?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>The Saracens replied: "Dear brothers, Amir <span style="color:blue">(173)</span>
                our tsar dwells outside the city; he dwells seven leagues from the city. He has many
                tents; one tent contains many thousands, strong and brave; one will attack a
                hundred." And the brothers said to the Saracens: "If we feared not God, we should
                long ago have put you to death. But we ask you, that we may not be tempted. Tell us,
                what sort of tent has Amir the tsar?"</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And the Saracens said: "Amir the tsar has a dark-red tent, green at the base; the
                tent is plated with gold and silver and pearl, and adorned with precious stones. His
                brother has a dark-blue tent, green at the base; his tent is likewise adorned. Other
                tents there are, full many; in them reside warriors. They receive from the tsar each
                year a revenue of one thousand and of two, and are strong and brave; one will attack
                a hundred."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>The brothers let them go to Amir the tsar and said to them: "Go, take word to Amir
                the tsar, lest Amir the tsar say, 'like robbers the brothers came and slew me'." The
                Saracens (were) glad to be let go, and went <span style="color:blue">(173v)</span>
                to take word to Amir the tsar.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And when Amir the tsar heard, he was afraid and said to his warriors: "My dear
                brothers, strong warriors, I had this night a dream that three hawks were beating me
                with their wings: they all but laid wounds on my body: it means that the brothers
                have come and will begin to quarrel with me."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>At that moment the brothers reached the tent of Amir the tsar and began to shout,
                calling out Amir the tsar: <span style="color:red">/e=37bis+45-48bis</span>

            <span>"Tell us, Amir the tsar, have you not guards posted on the way? We reached the
                tent without any resistance.<span style="color:red"> </span>But now tell us – may
                the bear wound you – you came and have stolen away our little sister like a thief.
                If we had chanced at home, you could not have escaped (with) our little sister, but
                would have died a wretched death and all your land would be in thrall to us. Now
                tell us, where have you put our little sister?"<span style="color:red">

        <p>
            <span>12.</span>
            <span>And Amir the tsar answered them: "My dear brothers, you see that mountain, great
                and fair? There (were slain many honored) women and fair maidens. And there <span
                    style="color:blue">(174)</span> was your sister slain because she had not done
                my will." The brothers said: "Dear brothers, let us go to that fair mountain and see
                the dead maiden: let us take her; then we shall deal with Amir the tsar." <span

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>13-17.</span>
            <span>They mounted their horses and went up and saw on the mountain many women and fair
                maidens slain. They began to seek their sister and found one maiden very fair and
                began to shed tears over her, believing she was their sister. But their youngest
                brother said: "She is not our sister and not our kin." <span style="color:red"
                    >/13-17</span></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>20.</span>
            <span>The brothers mounted their horses and were loudly singing the angelic hymn to the
                Lord: "Blessed be the Lord our God; teach our hands to battle, our fingers to
                struggle. Let us remember, brothers, the word of our mother: one day we were born,
                one day <span style="font-style:italic">we<i> </i></span>too shall die; at the
                bidding of our mother let us lay down our heads for our little sister." <span

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>f-g.</span>
            <span>And they charged the tent of Amir the tsar and lifted the tent on their lances,
                calling out Amir the tsar.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>But Amir the tsar said to them: "My dear <span style="color:blue">(174v)</span>
                brothers, get you gone from this tent and cast lots among you to see which one of
                you the lot calls to fight with me. If you overcome me, take your little sister. If
                I overcome you, it is my pleasure to slay all of you."<span style="color:red"
                ></span></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And the brothers rode off from the tent and began to cast lots; they cast the
                first time and the lot called the youngest to go to battle. And the brothers cast
                lots a second time, but it was for the youngest to go. Because he is not strong,
                they cast a third time out of pity for their brother, but it came out for the
                youngest brother to go to battle. And the brothers said to the youngest brother:
                "Since you came forth from our mother's womb together with your little sister, you
                and your sister cannot be separated." <span style="color:red">/f-g</span></span>

            <span>And the brothers began to arm the youngest brother. And where the brothers were
                standing, that place shines like the sun, but where Amir the tsar is arming, that
                place is dark as darkness. The brothers raise the angelic hymn to God: "Sire, suffer
                not Thy <span style="color:blue">(175)</span> creature to be the sport of pagans,
                lest the pagans rejoice, having dishonored a Christian maiden." <span

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>5.</span>
            <span>And mounting their horses they came down, as did Amir the tsar. They began to hack
                with sabers and they smote one another with swords and with lances.<span

            <span>But when the Saracens and the many warriors saw this, the boldness of the youngest
                brother, they said to Amir the tsar: "Great Lord, give them back their sister and
                make peace with them, for lo! their youngest brother has conquered your strength. If
                they join together, all our land will be in thrall to them." <span

            <span>The youngest brother, grasping his mace, came up behind Amir the tsar and smote
                him between the shoulders with the mace and knocked him off his horse and grasped
                him by the hair and dragged him to his brothers. All the Saracens said loudly to
                Amir the tsar: "Give back, Lord and Tsar, their sister, lest they destroy you
                utterly." <span style="color:red">/6 </span></span>

            <span>"I wish to speak to you, my brothers, and first I wish to adjure you by the prayer
                of our mother that you fail not to hearken to my command. If only Amir the tsar will
                truly renounce his faith and this day receive holy baptism, you will call no other
                brother-in-law, since he is in glory glorious, in strength strong, and in riches
                rich." The brothers said to their sister: "Our mother's prayer has joined you to
                Amir the tsar."</span>

        <p>
            <span>At that time Amir the tsar collected three hundred camels and loaded them with
                precious Arab gold and gave them to the brothers <span style="color:blue"
                    >(176v)</span> as gifts for love of the maiden. Amir the tsar said to the
                brothers: "Have mercy on me, my dear brothers. I shall renounce my faith and this
                day receive holy baptism, that I may be your brother-in-law."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And the brothers said to Amir the tsar: "If you would be our brother-in-law, truly
                renounce your faith for love of this maiden, receive holy baptism, and go with us to
                the Greek land with your beloved maiden."<span style="color:red">

            <span>64-65.</span>
            <span>But Amir the tsar said: "Dear brothers, I shall not surrender shamefully, lest the
                Greeks say, 'they bring their brother-in-law like a captive.' I shall be called your
                brother-in-law; in great honor shall I come. I wish first to go and collect camels
                from all the land and load riches upon them. And I wish to assemble strong warriors,
                and whoever wishes to accept holy baptism with me, <span style="color:red">/64-65

            <span>and I shall come to you in the Greek land and I shall be called your
                brother-in-law and I shall be glorious and rich. Do not weary your horses; wait for
                me on the road." And the brothers, taking their sister, went their way.<span

            <span>Amir the tsar, going to his mother <span style="color:blue">(177)</span> and to
                his brothers, began to speak to them with guile, that they might not restrain him.
                And he said to his mother: "My dear mother, I went to the Greek land and captured
                for myself a beloved maiden. And her brothers came after me and began to fight with
                me. And one of them conquered <span style="font-style:italic">my<i

        <p>
            <span>35bis.</span>
            <span>But his mother spoke to Amir the tsar angrily: (she began) to tear the hair from
                her head and (to tear) (her) face, <span style="color:red">/35bis </span></span>

            <span>(and she said to him): "Why are you called tsar and have strong warriors serving
                you; they receive a revenue of the thousand and of two thousand. Go, assemble a
                great force and go to the Greek land and conquer the brothers and bring the beloved

            <span>And Amir the tsar said with guile to his mother: "Mother, I wish to do the same:
                to assemble warriors and go to attack the Greek land." A brother of Amir the tsar
                said: "Let us go, Amir the tsar, after we have quickly assembled a force, that we
                may keep the brothers from the city with the beloved maiden."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>But Amir the tsar said to his brother: "Sit on my throne; I wish to go alone to
                attack the Greek land." At that moment Amir the tsar sat <span style="color:blue"
                    >(177v)</span> his brother on his throne, while he himself assembled a great
                force and collected riches and camels from all that land, heaping precious Arab gold
                and costly stones upon them. The Saracens knew that men go not thus to battle but
                said nothing to him.<span style="color:red">

            <span>68.</span>
            <span>When Amir the tsar reached (the border of the Greek land, Amir the tsar said) to

            <span>"My dear brothers, strong Arab warriors, who will go with me to attack the Greek
                land?" There spoke from among them (one) Arab with twelve locks on his lips, and he
                said loudly to Amir the tsar: "Great Lord, Amir Tsar, there came from the Greek land
                to our Saracen land three youths. One of them conquered your strength; if all three
                should join together, all our land would be in thrall. Now you wish to attack the
                Greek land: they will destroy all utterly." But Amir the tsar sent on ahead the
                camels loaded with riches, took with him a few of his warriors, and went to the
                Greek land. <span style="color:red">/69</span></span>

        <p>
            <span>30bis-31.</span>
            <span>The brothers came within fifty leagues of the Greek city <span style="color:blue"
                    >(178)</span> and halted. And their sister began to entreat them: "My dear
                brothers, do not bring me into great shame before men and before my kindred because
                I was stolen away by Amir the tsar. Wait for your brother-in-law."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>After a little <span>time</span> the tsar Amir came up to them with all his riches
                and with the camels loaded with gold and silver. And Amir the tsar said to them:
                "Glory to Thee, God, who hast been my benefactor. God hath found me worthy to look
                in the eyes of my brothers." And the brothers said to Amir the tsar: "Slave of
                Christ, this very day be our brother-in-law."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Two of the brothers, the eldest and the middle, (with) their little sister went to
                the city at night because of the people and reached the house of their mother. When
                their mother saw her two sons and her daughter, she said to them tearfully: "you
                have won your little sister but you have lost your brother." But her sons said:
                "Rejoice, Mother, our youngest is together with our brother-in-law, with Amir the
                tsar. Now prepare a great wedding, since we have won a brother-in-law in glory
                glorious, and in strength strong and in riches rich; now we shall lead him to godly
                baptism."</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>And taking the patriarch of the city with all the clergy they went to the river
                Euphrates and built <span style="color:blue">(178v)</span> a font (and) a host of
                people came forth from the city. At that time Amir the tsar came to the river
                Euphrates, and when the brothers saw Amir the tsar harassed (by the people), taking
                Amir the tsar they quickly plunged him in godly baptism. And the patriarch himself
                baptized him: his godfather is the patriarch himself of the city. And they led him
                to the house of their mother and held a great wedding, very glorious, for three
                months. And then Amir the tsar built his own court and chambers and began to live
                with his wife. <span style="color:red">/30bis-31</span></span>

            <span>After a little time, when the mother of Amir the tsar heard that Amir the tsar had

            <span>and assembled the forces of the Saracen land and said to them: "Who has the
                boldness to go to the Greek land (to your Lord, Amir the tsar, and bring him back
                from the Greek land with his beloved maiden?" And three Saracens said to her: "We
                shall go, Lady, to the Greek land) and bear (a letter) to Amir the tsar." She gave
                them much gold and silver, <span style="color:red">/40 </span></span>
        </p>
        <p>

            <span>and gave them three horses: (a horse) called Windflower, a second, Thunder, a
                third, Lightning, and (said): "If you are in the Greek land and see your lord, Amir

                    style="color:blue">(179)</span> and he will not be (harmed) by anyone. If you
                enter the Saracen land with your lord, Amir the tsar, and with the maiden, seat them
                on Thunder, and then all the Arabs of the Saracen land will hear. If you sit on
